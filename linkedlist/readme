Points to remember

When dealing with linkedlist problems, one should remember the follows:
1) dummy node like for "Merge two sorted lists", "Remove Nth Node From End Of List"
2) LinkedList can be split: "Sort List", "Insertion sort list"
3) To find the middle, slow and fast pointers are used.
4) To reverse the list, we need 3 pointers: prev, curr, next


/// Find node with given key
1)
Node temp = head;
while (temp.next != null) {
    if (temp.next == key) {
        temp.next = temp.next.next;
        return;
    }
    temp = temp.next;
}

Node temp = head;
Node prev = null;
while (temp != null) {
    if (temp.key == key) {
        prev.next = temp.next;
        return
    }
    temp = temp.next;
}
