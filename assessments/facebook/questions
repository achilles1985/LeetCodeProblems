Given a floor plan, which includes the rooms ('O'), the obstacles ('X') and a robot vacuum ('R'),
your goal is to return the set of rooms that are farthest from the robot vacuum (when the robot takes the shortest path).
  The robot vacuum only move vertically and horizontally (not diagonally). So for instance an example floor plan is

    0 1 2 3 4
0   4 3 4 5 6
1   3 2 3 4 5
2   2 1 X 5 6
3   1 R X 6 (this)
4   2 1 X (this) X

For which the answers include (4, 3) and (3, 4) (i.e the two tiles in the  bottom right corner) having the distance of 7.
